        <h2>What is The Big Three?</h2>
        
        <p>What is The Big Three you ask? Well, for those of us who are familiar with anime, The Big Three is a term used to describe the three most popular running anime series during their golden age in Shonen Jump's mid 2000s period. <br> 
        
        These three are also some of the most iconic anime in the industry sporting large numbers of sales in both of their respective anime and manga. <br>
        
        Personally, I have to say I've always preferred Bleach and Naruto, but One Piece has it's charms. Let's talk a bit about each one: </p>

            <p>
                "We are taught never to shed tears. <br> 
                For to shed tears means that the body has been defeated by emotion. <br>
                And to us, this simple act of crying proves, without question, that the existence of emotion is nothing but a burden.”
